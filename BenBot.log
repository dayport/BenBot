    [3] => Don't you call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease!
    [4] => R2 says the chances of survival are 725... to one
    [5] => Wait. Oh My ! What have you done. I'm backwards you filthy furball
    [6] => We're doomed!
    [7] => R2-D2, where are you?
    [8] => R2-D2, it is you, It Is You!
    [9] => Excuse me sir, but that R2-D2 is in prime condition, a real bargain
    [10] => If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short circuit
    [11] => Die Jedi Dogs! Oh what did I say?
    [12] => R2D2! You know better than to trust a strange computer!
    [13] => I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!
    [14] => I beg your pardon, but what do you mean, "naked?".. My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness, oh!
    [15] => You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea, and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlaac.
    [16] => His high exaltedness, the Great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
    [17] => In his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
    [18] => It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
    [19] => If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to lightspeed.
    [20] => Oh, yes, that's much better... Something's not right, because now I can't see. Oh, oh, yes, that's much better. Wait... wait. Oh, my. What have you done? I'm BACKWARDS. You flea-bitten furball. Only an overgrown mop-head like you would be stupid enough to...
    [21] => Oh. They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is.
    [22] => Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal!
    [23] => Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
    [24] => Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1!
    [25] => Listen to them, they're dying, R2. Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault. My poor master!
    [26] => Just you reconsider playing that message for him! No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.
