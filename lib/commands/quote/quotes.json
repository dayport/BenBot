	"Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.",
	"I suggest a new strategy, Artoo: let the Wookie win.",
	"Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.",
	"Don't you call me a mindless philosopher you overweight glob of grease!",
	"R2 says the chances of survival are 725... to one",
	"Wait. Oh My ! What have you done. I'm backwards you filthy furball",
	"We're doomed!",
	"R2-D2, where are you?",
	"R2-D2, it is you, It Is You!",
	"Excuse me sir, but that R2-D2 is in prime condition, a real bargain",
	"If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short circuit",
	"Die Jedi Dogs! Oh what did I say?",
	"R2D2! You know better than to trust a strange computer!",
	"I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!",
	"I beg your pardon, but what do you mean, \"naked?\".. My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness, oh!",
	"You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea, and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlaac.",
	"His high exaltedness, the Great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.",
	"In his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.",
	"It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.",
	"If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to lightspeed.",
	"Oh, yes, that's much better... Something's not right, because now I can't see. Oh, oh, yes, that's much better. Wait... wait. Oh, my. What have you done? I'm BACKWARDS. You flea-bitten furball. Only an overgrown mop-head like you would be stupid enough to...",
	"Oh. They've encased him in Carbonite. He should be quite well protected. If he survived the freezing process, that is.",
	"Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal!",
	"Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.",
	"Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1!",
	"Listen to them, they're dying, R2. Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault. My poor master!",
	"Just you reconsider playing that message for him! No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.",
	"I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay here with you. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but I'm sure it must be your fault!"
